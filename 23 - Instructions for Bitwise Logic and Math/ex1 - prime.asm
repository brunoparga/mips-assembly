# Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer. The program then
# tests if the integer is prime and writes out its result.

# A number is prime if it cannot be divided evenly by any number other than 1
# and itself. So you will need a counting loop that starts at two and divides
# the number for each value of the loop counter until the number is divided
# evenly or the limit is reached.

# For the upper limit of the loop use the number divided by two. (A better upper
# limit would be the square root of the number, see below.)

# The logic for this exercise has already been implemented in chapter 19,
# exercise 4.
