# Add two methods to the Complete Program> (above). Add a clear() method that
# makes the first byte of an objects string the null byte (in effect deleting the
# string). Add a capitalize() method that changes each lower case character of
# the object's string to a capital letter. Do this by adding 0x20 to each lower
# case letter. Modify main to test the new methods.
